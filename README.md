# Udacity-Project-Investigate-a-Relational-Database

## Description
I did this project as part of Udacity's Programming for Data Science with Python nanodegree. Despite the name, much of the nanodegree was focused on SQL. This project showcases my ability to write complex queries to answer questions. The dataset used for the project was provided by Udacity and had made up information about movie rental stores. 

## Files
queries.txt: Contains the queries I wrote for the project.
SQL_Project_Slides.pdf: Contains the slides I created for the project. The visuals on the slides were created using the results of the queries in queries.txt.
